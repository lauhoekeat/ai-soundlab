# AI SoundLab setup · public session release

The published frontend is [GitHub Pages](https://lauhoekeat.github.io/ai-soundlab/). The secured API is `https://ai-soundlab-proxy.ai-soundlab.workers.dev`. Node 22+ and Cloudflare Wrangler are required for development or deployment. The owner has already configured the local key and authenticated Wrangler.

## Local checks

```powershell
npm ci
npm run check
npm run test:runtime
node scripts/init-local.mjs
npm run dev
```

`init-local` creates ignored `proxy/.env` only when absent and never overwrites an existing file. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AI_ENABLED=true` there privately; keep `IP_HASH_SECRET` random and at least 32 characters. Never paste the key in chat or put it in a `VITE_` variable, source, GitHub, or a browser. `git check-ignore proxy/.env` confirms ignore status. Do not print the env file.

For local API use, run `npm run proxy:dev` in another terminal. The frontend's `VITE_PROXY_URL` is a public Worker URL, not a secret. All AI calls send bounded written answers only. Audio and names are never sent by app code; tell pupils not to include names or personal details in written answers.

## Hosted Worker and Pages

`proxy/wrangler.jsonc` carries the exact allowed origins and caps: 12 public requests/minute, 20/IP/minute, 200/day and 2,000/month. Input is capped at 8 KiB. Model responses are capped and time-limited. IP addresses are HMAC-hashed with a server secret for quota keys; no pupil answer or audio database is used. Quota rejection is visible and makes no OpenAI call. These limits are spend controls, not identity verification.

The two hosted secrets are `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `IP_HASH_SECRET`. To update them from the ignored local env after verifying the intended Cloudflare account:

```powershell
node scripts/upload-proxy-secrets.mjs
npm run proxy:deploy
```

The upload script transports secret values to Wrangler's stdin and redacts output. For manual upload, use `npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY --config proxy/wrangler.jsonc` and similarly for `IP_HASH_SECRET`; enter values only at Wrangler's private prompt. The retired hosted `CLASS_CODE` secret was deleted after this release. Do not commit secrets.

The public GitHub Actions variable `VITE_PROXY_URL` points to the Worker. Pages source is GitHub Actions; merging a tested change triggers deployment. Before claiming a release is live, confirm the Actions run and load the published URL. `npm run test:live` makes two paid synthetic requests to the hosted API. `node scripts/hosted-security-gate.mjs` checks the hosted boundary without paid requests.

## Classroom use and limits

Pupils can complete all four simulations and write answers without AI. They may opt in separately to each AI check. They must finish four missions before the five-question assessment opens. Answers and reports remain in memory only and disappear on reload/closing the tab. No login, teacher mode, class code, Evidence Book, IndexedDB write, or export is used in this release. Existing data saved by older releases on a prior device is not read by this release; clear the browser's site data separately if desired.

Microphone permission is requested only when a pupil chooses recording. The ruler comparison needs a quiet baseline and a ruler-sound sample; the graph shows microphone signal, not direct ruler movement. Echo's optional recording is replayed locally with a synthetic reflected copy. Sound Travel and Echo show slowed models; displayed model times are explanatory, not instrument measurements. The AI reviews text, never listens to recordings or identifies their source. Practice scores are not official PBD judgments.

For a release check, test on a laptop and a physical phone: permissions, stop/playback, leaving-page microphone cleanup, both Travel listener drag and keyboard movement, Echo hard/soft trials, optional echo recording, stage AI, five-question assessment, and quota/error states. Obtain Science-teacher review of the current rubric; prior approval applied to an older feedback bank.
